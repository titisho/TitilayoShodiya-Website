        <div class="subheading mb-5">Hair Care Professional, B.S. Biology</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Born and raised in Carson, California, Titilayo Shodiya was raised by loving Nigerian parents, 1 older sister, 3 older brothers, and a twin sister. Titilayo attended St. Philomena School in Carson, graduating at the top 10% of her 8th grade class. Titi attended Mary Star of the Sea High School for 4 years, before graduating in 2019 at the top 10% of her senior class, again, at 16 years old. She began her college career attending the University of California, Riverside during the Fall 2019 quarter and is on track to graduate with her Bachelor’s of Science degree in Biology for the Spring 2023 quarter. Titilayo aspires to gain her Master’s of Science degree in Public Health from a university of her choice before attaining a career in the Biotech industry as a Research Coordinator.<br><br>

        Titi’s passion for science and haircare comes from her love of helping those that need patience and guidance the most. Growing up, her and her twin sister grew their love of hair together, trying new and fun styles on each other, like box and knotless braids, passion twists, short and long faux locs, and mini braided styles. Titi always encourages the people around her with textured hair to love their hair completely in its natural state.

“As I attended schools with a very low population of Black individuals, I took little care of my hair because I didn’t know how to style it in a way that would be naturally similar to the looser textured hair I saw on a regular basis at school. Because I was never able to portray that look, I began to have very low self-confidence. It wasn’t until I graduated high school and was more around people who looked like me, that I started to love and take care of the hair that grew out of my scalp. I started researching ways to keep my hair moisturized, retain my length, and grow my hair. Then, I was in love with the newfound me. There was a lot of trial and error, but I found methods and products that worked especially well with not only my hair type (4B), but also my hair texture (coily to smooth). My methods worked for my entire family, and in order to prove its not only genetics that strengthened and grew our hair, I created a product that I offered to friends. This product did wonders for their hair, and I knew I was sitting on something special.<br><br>

        I created this line specifically for those who have a hard time figuring out how to learn and love their hair. This line is for all the Black individuals who have been told, ‘Your hair is ugly!’, ‘You need to do something with your hair. It’s too nappy!’, or ‘Your hair is unprofessional in its natural state.’ This line aims to create hope in those that want to love themselves in all their natural glory. This line hopes to instill a sense of confidence in those that need it. If I could create something that could help little Black boys and girls learn to love ALL of their Blackness, then I did something right.”
